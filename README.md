# EmbededSystemsDesign
ESD 1

The technical objective of this laboratory is to design an embedded system for the Nios II processor and DE1-SoC development board that will execute three different C programs that do the following: 

1. Uses polling to increment/decrement a counter when KEY1 is pushed  

2. Uses interrupts to increment/decrement a counter when KEY1 is pushed 

3. Maintains the functionality of #2 in addition to flashing the LEDs every 100 ms using a timer interrupt
