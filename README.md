ESD 1

Education Objective 

The educational objective of this demo is to become familiar with Alteraâ€™s TimeQuest tool used to assist in properly constraining and analyzing paths in the FPGA on the DE1-SoC board.


 Technical Objective 
 
 The technical objective of this laboratory is to design a simple adder on the DE1-SoC that will allow for a deeper look into timing failures, analysis, and eventually timing closure
