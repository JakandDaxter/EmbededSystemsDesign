# EmbededSystemsDesign
ESD 1


The technical objective of this laboratory is to design a custom component for the NIOS II that stores eight 32-bit values. Conduit interfaces to the DE1-SoC board allow for an address to be entered through the switches and the value stored at that location to be displayed on the LEDs. The component generates an interrupt to the NIOS II if the address on the switches is greater than 7.
