# EmbededSystemsDesign
ESD 1

Educational Objective 

The purpose of this exercise is to investigate the use of a bus bridge to interface the NIOS II with an external component, the use of Altera’s MegaWizard Plug-in Manager to create a RAM module and the creation of an arbitration scheme to manage two components writing to the same RAM location.

Technical Objective

The technical objective of this demonstration is to learn how to communicate using a bus. In the designs generated by Altera’s QSYS system builder, the Nios II processor connects to peripheral devices by means of the Avalon Switch Fabric. To connect to the switch fabric, previous demonstrations and labs required the creation of a QSYS custom component. To make it possible to investigate the bus communication, without requiring the creation of a custom component, this exercise will use the Avalon to External Bus Bridge component. The bridge allows the designer to create a peripheral device and connects it to the Nios II system in the Quartus software. The Avalon to External Bus Bridge creates a bus-like interface to which one or more “slave” peripherals can be connected.
