# EmbededSystemsDesign
ESD 1


Education Objective
  The educational objective of this laboratory is to investigate the creation of custom IP to interface with the NIOS II on the Avalon Switch Fabric. This lab is two parts, combined with Lab 5. Lab 4 focuses on the creation of the core, and Lab 5 on the software interfacing with the component.  

 Technical Objective
    The technical objective of this laboratory is to design an embedded system for the Nios II processor and DE1-SoC development board that will control a servo motor to sweep between two angles. 
 
The embedded system should contain a custom IP that creates the appropriate Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) signal to sweep the servo-motor’s arm. The system also contains 8 switches for entering the start and stop angles, 2 pushbuttons for “locking” in the angles and 5 seven-segment displays for displaying the start and stop angles.
