# EmbededSystemsDesign
ESD 1

Educational Objective: The purpose of this exercise is to investigate and compare the influence of
different configurations of cache memory and on-chip and off-chip memory systems on the performance
of a microprocessor-based embedded system.
First read through the demo and answer the questions/fill out predictions. Perform experiments to see if
your predictions were accurate.
The experiment will be conducted by running simple program loops with different NIOS II configurations.
Code is included to use the periodic timer core to measure program loop duration
